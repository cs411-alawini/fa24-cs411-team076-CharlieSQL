## Project Summary
	Our project title is the Sleep Assistant. The goal for the project is to create a website with an interface that allows users to access a variety of different metrics related to sleep and then determine how many hours of sleep they should get per day. The databases connected to the website would contain a variety of different values, such as peopleâ€™s gender, age, their physical activity, stress levels, BMI, and more. The database also contains the number of hours of sleep a person with those metrics takes and when that corresponds to better health and sleep quality. The user must enter in their own information for each of these different items and then the website will output the proper number of hours of sleep that the user needs to maintain a good standard of health.
