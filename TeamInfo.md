## Project Summary
	Our project title is the DiabetesInsight. The goal for the project is to create a website with an interface that allows users to access a variety of different metrics related to diabetes and then determine the odds that they are likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. The databases connected to the website would contain a variety of different values, such as people’s gender, age, their physical activity, stress levels, BMI, and more. The database also contains a boolean value of 0 or 1 that indicates if someone has gotten diabetes or not. The user must enter in their own information for each of these different items and then the website will output the individual’s risk of getting diabetes.
